A website built with Nexjs to check real-time prices of Crypto currencies along with some additional info such as 24h price change, Market cap etc. <br /><br />
I built this web app with Nextjs to make it load fast and get benefit of Server-side-rendering Nextjs offers, which loads web app on the server before displaying it on browser. <br /><br />
A crypto API is used to display the real-time crypto data.
