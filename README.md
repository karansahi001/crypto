A website built with Typescript Reactjs to check real-time prices of Crypto currencies along with some additional info such as 24h price change, Market cap etc. <br /><br />

I used React Chartjs to show the crypto prices in the form of a line chart. <br /><br />
A crypto API is used to display the real-time crypto data.<br/> <br/>

This is my first Typescript with Reactjs project. I used to think that typescript is not worth learning, but now I just LOVE typescript and gonna use it in every project. <br/>
